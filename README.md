Milestone 2 - Search for coffee bars in Amsterdam - Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project
This website is available to view here - 

This website has been created to allow users to search for a coffee bar or place in Amsterdam and to find out more information on the accommodation, food and drink, and points of interest available within the area that they have searched for. 
With the help of Google Maps JavaScript API, users can obtain this information through pop up windows that are triggered when a radio button has been checked, e.g. when the accommodation radio button is checked, markers will appear on the map displaying accommodation within the area that has been searched for. 
The Maps API also allows users to view StreetView images and satellite imagery.

UX
This website is targeted towards users aiming to travel to a planned destination or towards users who want to find out more about accommodation, places to eat or attractions within an area they are curious about. 
This type of user will want to know where places to stay and places to eat are, and also points of interest which they may like to visit on their holiday. My project is a suitable way of achieving this because it provides filters for the user to use when they search for a place to visit and also provides them with information such as addresses and telephone numbers of establishments they are interested in. It is an easy-to-use website - all the user has to do is type in their chosen location into the search bar, select a query and a filter, and then select a marker on the map to reveal the information they are seeking. Once they have found what they are looking for, the user can click on the place name in the info window which takes them to Google Maps, providing more information such as reviews and ratings. The user may also use the Streetview feature and satellite imagery to get a better understanding of what the location they searched for looks like.
